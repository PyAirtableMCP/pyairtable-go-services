## Integration with Existing Architecture

The workflows integrate seamlessly with your existing PyAirtable architecture:

### Event-Driven Integration
- All workflows emit events to the existing event bus
- Events are persisted in the PostgreSQL event store
- CQRS projections are automatically updated

### SAGA Integration
- Complex workflows use SAGA patterns for distributed transactions
- Compensation logic handles rollbacks
- Workflow state is managed through the SAGA orchestrator

### Microservices Communication
- Workflows communicate with existing services via HTTP/gRPC
- Service discovery and load balancing are handled transparently
- Circuit breakers and retries provide resilience

### Monitoring Integration
- Metrics are collected and exposed via Prometheus
- Logs are structured and forwarded to your logging infrastructure
- Distributed traces provide end-to-end visibility

## API Endpoints

Each workflow type exposes REST APIs for management:

```
POST /api/v1/workflows                    # Create workflow
GET  /api/v1/workflows/{id}              # Get workflow status
PUT  /api/v1/workflows/{id}              # Update workflow
DELETE /api/v1/workflows/{id}            # Delete workflow
POST /api/v1/workflows/{id}/execute      # Execute workflow
POST /api/v1/workflows/{id}/cancel       # Cancel workflow
POST /api/v1/workflows/{id}/pause        # Pause workflow
POST /api/v1/workflows/{id}/resume       # Resume workflow
GET  /api/v1/workflows/{id}/executions   # List executions
GET  /api/v1/workflows/{id}/metrics      # Get metrics
GET  /api/v1/workflows/{id}/health       # Health status
