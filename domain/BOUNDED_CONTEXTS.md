# Bounded Contexts for PyAirtable Compose

This document defines the bounded contexts and their relationships within the PyAirtable Compose system following Domain-Driven Design principles.

## 1. User & Authentication Context

**Purpose**: Manages user identity, authentication, and authorization across the platform.

**Core Concepts**:
- User identity and lifecycle
- Authentication mechanisms (OAuth, JWT, sessions)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- User profiles and preferences

**Aggregate Roots**:
- `UserAggregate`: Complete user lifecycle management
- `AuthSessionAggregate`: Session and token management

**Domain Events**:
- UserRegistered
- UserAuthenticated
- UserRoleChanged
- UserDeactivated

**Key Business Rules**:
- Users must have unique email addresses
- Authentication sessions expire after inactivity
- Users can only access resources within their tenant scope
- Role changes require appropriate permissions

## 2. Workspace & Collaboration Context

**Purpose**: Manages workspaces, teams, projects, and collaboration features.

**Core Concepts**:
- Workspace organization and hierarchy
- Team membership and permissions
- Project management within workspaces
- Collaboration tools and sharing

**Aggregate Roots**:
- `WorkspaceAggregate`: Workspace lifecycle and membership
- `ProjectAggregate`: Project management within workspaces

**Domain Events**:
- WorkspaceCreated
- MemberAdded
- MemberRoleChanged
- ProjectShared
- CollaborationStarted

**Key Business Rules**:
- Workspaces must belong to a tenant
- Users can be members of multiple workspaces
- Workspace owners can manage all aspects
- Members inherit base permissions plus explicit grants

## 3. Airtable Integration Context

**Purpose**: Handles all Airtable-specific operations, data synchronization, and API management.

**Core Concepts**:
- Airtable base connections and configuration
- Data synchronization and mapping
- API rate limiting and quotas
- Schema management and field mapping

**Aggregate Roots**:
- `AirtableBaseAggregate`: Base connection and configuration
- `SyncJobAggregate`: Data synchronization operations

**Domain Events**:
- BaseConnected
- SyncStarted
- SyncCompleted
- SyncFailed
- SchemaChanged

**Key Business Rules**:
- Each base connection requires valid API credentials
- Sync operations must respect Airtable rate limits
- Schema changes require validation before applying
- Failed syncs trigger retry mechanisms with backoff

## 4. Automation & Workflow Context

**Purpose**: Manages automated workflows, triggers, and business process automation.

**Core Concepts**:
- Workflow definition and execution
- Trigger management (time-based, event-based)
- Action execution and error handling
- Workflow templates and sharing

**Aggregate Roots**:
- `WorkflowAggregate`: Workflow definition and lifecycle
- `ExecutionAggregate`: Workflow execution tracking

**Domain Events**:
- WorkflowCreated
- WorkflowActivated
- WorkflowTriggered
- ExecutionStarted
- ExecutionCompleted
- ExecutionFailed

**Key Business Rules**:
- Workflows must have at least one trigger and one action
- Executions are tracked for audit and debugging
- Failed executions trigger alerting mechanisms
- Workflows can be shared across workspaces with permissions

## Context Relationships

### User & Auth ↔ Workspace & Collaboration
- **Relationship**: Customer/Supplier
- **Integration**: Users authenticate and access workspaces
- **Shared Concepts**: User identity, roles, permissions

### Workspace & Collaboration ↔ Airtable Integration
- **Relationship**: Customer/Supplier
- **Integration**: Workspaces contain Airtable base connections
- **Shared Concepts**: Project context, data access permissions

### Airtable Integration ↔ Automation & Workflow
- **Relationship**: Customer/Supplier
- **Integration**: Workflows operate on Airtable data and events
- **Shared Concepts**: Data events, sync status, schema information

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Tenant Isolation**: All contexts respect tenant boundaries
- **Audit Logging**: All significant domain events are logged
- **Event Sourcing**: Domain events enable eventual consistency
- **CQRS**: Read and write models are separated where beneficial

## Anti-Corruption Layers

Each context maintains anti-corruption layers to:
- Prevent external concepts from polluting the domain model
- Translate between different bounded contexts
- Maintain domain integrity and independence
- Handle integration failures gracefully

## Integration Patterns

1. **Domain Events**: Primary integration mechanism for eventual consistency
2. **Shared Kernel**: Common value objects and base types
3. **Published Language**: Well-defined APIs and contracts
4. **Conformist**: Integration with external Airtable API

This bounded context design ensures:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Maintainable and testable code
- Scalable team organization
- Flexible deployment options
